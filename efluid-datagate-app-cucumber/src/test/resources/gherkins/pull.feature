Feature: The backlog can be imported and merged with local changes

  The backlog content (commit with indexes, lob content and attachments) can be imported, and mixed (merged)
  with the changes from the locale instance using fixed merging rules

  Background:
    Given the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" :
      | key | value | other     |
      | JJJ | One   | Other JJJ |
      | KKK | Two   | Other KKK |
      | VVV | 333   | Other VVV |
      | III | 444   | Other III |
    And the existing data in managed table "TTAB_FIVE" :
      | key | data                | simple |
      | 1   | ABCDEF1234567ABDDDD | 17.81  |
      | 2   | ABCDEF1234567ABEEEE | 17.82  |
      | 3   | ABCDEF1234567ABFFFF | 17.83  |
    And the existing data in managed table "TTAB_SIX" :
      | identifier | text                                     | date       |
      | 7          | Ceci est un text enregistr√© dans un CLOB | 2012-01-15 |
      | 8          | Un autre text CLOB                       | 2005-07-08 |
      | 9          | Encore un autre                          | 2021-12-25 |

  Scenario: Commits are prepared in a destination environment before importing a package - merge init state
    Given the commit ":tada: Test commit init source" has been saved and exported with all the identified initial diff content
    And the user accesses to the destination environment with the same dictionary
    And the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" in destination environment :
      | key | value | other     |
      | VVV | 333   | Other VVV |
      | III | 444   | Other III |
    And a commit ":construction: Destination commit 1" has been saved with all the new identified diff content in destination environment
    When the user do nothing more
    Then the commit ":construction: Destination commit 1" is added to commit list for current project in destination environment
    And the exported commit ":tada: Test commit init source" is not present in the destination environment

  Scenario: The dedicated merge diff with changes from destination environment is started when importing a package
    Given the commit ":tada: Test commit init source" has been saved and exported with all the identified initial diff content
    And the user accesses to the destination environment with the same dictionary
    And the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" in destination environment :
      | key | value | other     |
      | VVV | 333   | Other VVV |
      | III | 444   | Other III |
    And a commit ":construction: Destination commit 1" has been saved with all the new identified diff content in destination environment
    When the user import the available source package
    Then a merge diff is running

  Scenario: The dedicated merge diff provides details on differences between imported package and local content - simple add content
    Given the commit ":tada: Test commit init source" has been saved and exported with all the identified initial diff content
    And the user accesses to the destination environment with the same dictionary
    And the existing data in managed table "TTAB_TWO" in destination environment :
      | key | value | other     |
      | VVV | 333   | Other VVV |
      | III | 444   | Other III |
    And a commit ":construction: Destination commit 1" has been saved with all the new identified diff content in destination environment
    And a merge diff has already been launched with the available source package
    And the merge diff is completed
    When the user access to diff commit page
    Then the merge commit content is rendered with these identified changes :
      | Table     | Key | Action | Need Resolve | Payload                                                                                                                         |
